          <p>
            Exit from a narrowing range: The range of the last candle is
            completely inside the range of the penultimate one and the price
            moves out of this range up or down.{" "}

              A signal for price movement upward occurs when the price breaks
              the high of the penultimate candlestick.

            3.1. Search for the optimal maximum position holding period for TSLA
          </h3>
          <p>
            For the generated signal, we conducted an MFE/MAE test (see
            definition here) in order to understand the most advantageous
            position holding time (in days), if this signal is followed. The
            higher the values of the MFE/MAE curve of 1, the more chances of
            getting the greatest return in relation to risk for a given position
            holding time (in days).
          </p>

          <p>
            The maximum value of the MAE/MAE curve (see the figure below)
            corresponds to the duration of holding an open position for{" "}
            <span>6 days</span>.

          <p>
            We found all the same signals in the period from 2010-07-06 to
            2021-07-22 (there were 164 of them) and calculated the probability
            of positive outcomes after 6 day(s) and other characteristics in
            case of following such signals.

            3.3. What happened to the TSLA price after generating the same
            signals in the past?
          </h3>
          <p>
            We generated 10 of the same signals in the past and tried to
            simulate what happened to the price for the next day, the next 2
            days, 3 days, 1 week, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months (price change as
            a percentage of the price value at which the signals were
            generated). From the table below, you can see that 10 signals were
            generated during the period from 2020-11-17 to 2021-06-23. Green
            blocks mean that the price has increased over a certain period. Red
            blocks mean that the price has decreased over a certain period. The
            percentage of price change is indicated inside the cell.

          <p>
            We also generated 10 trajectories with a duration of 10 days of TSLA
            price movement after each of the 10 signals was generated (see the
            picture below). The red line is the average for all such
            trajectories and describes how the TSLA price has changed on average
            after generating the same signals in the past.

          <h3>3.4. Optimal stop loss and take profit for the signal</h3>
          <p>
            We tested the TSLA for the period from 2010-07-06 to 2021-07-22 to
            find the best combination of stop loss and take profit levels for
            the ‚ÄúExit from a narrowing range‚Äù signal.
          </p>

          <p>
            We used 2 models for setting a stop loss: by the size of the
            candlestick pattern, relative to which the signal is generated, and
            by ATR (
            <a
              href="https://school.stockcharts.com/doku.php?id=technical_indicators:average_true_range_atr"
              target="_blank"
              rel="noreferrer"
            >
              Average True Range
            </a>
            ). The stop loss level is additionally varied by multiplying its
            size by a coefficient from the interval from 0.5 to 3.5. The take
            profit level is calculated relative to the size of the stop loss and
            additionally varies by multiplying the size of the stop loss by a
            coefficient from the interval from 0.5 to 5.
          </p>
          <p>
            The criterion for the optimal combination of stop loss and take
            profit was maximization of the average return on the signal for the
            period from 2010-07-06 to 2021-07-22.
          </p>
          <p>For the model of setting a stop loss relative to the size of the signal candlestick pattern, we got the following result:</p>

        <p>For the generated signal, we additionally carried out the "Same Stop and Take Profit Test". We have modeled the percentage of profitable trades when placing a protective stop order and take profit at the same distance from the signal generation point. For testing, we used 2 types of stop order distance from the signal generation point, multiplied by a factor from 0.5 to 3.5 with a step of 0.5: a distance equal to the size of the candlestick pattern and a distance equal to the ATR for the TSLA instrument at the moment of signal generation.</p>
